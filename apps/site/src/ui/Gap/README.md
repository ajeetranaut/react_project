# Gap Component

The `Gap` component is a simple React component designed to create vertical spacing or gaps between elements on your webpage. It provides flexibility by allowing you to customize the gap using
the `className` prop or falling back to a default value.

## Usage

```jsx
import React from "react";
import { Gap } from "@/ui"; // Replace with the actual path to the Gap component

const MyPage = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      {/* Your other components */}
      <Gap />
      {/* More content */}
    </div>
  );
};

export default MyPage;
```

## Props

The `Gap` component accepts the following optional prop:

- `className` (string): Custom CSS class name to be applied for styling. If not provided, a default spacing class will be applied.

## Default Props

The `Gap` component has default data provided through the `defaultProps` object. You can use this default data for testing the component or customize it as needed.

## Note

Adjust the default spacing values in the `className` prop according to your design requirements. This component is a convenient way to manage vertical spacing between elements in your layout.
